### 💡 Mentorship Program for Young Immigrants

I founded and lead a mentorship program that supports elementary and middle school students from immigrant backgrounds who are academically strong but lack access to opportunities. We run weekly Zoom sessions with hands-on STEM activities, guest speakers, and goal setting — helping students grow their confidence and curiosity.

> 📈 Currently serving students across Maryland and planning to expand this summer with a showcase and digital portfolios.

### 🌐 Free Global STEM Resource Guide

I’m building a free, curated guide of resources — including competitions, scholarships, internships, virtual labs, and self-paced courses — especially for students from underrepresented or low-income communities.

> 🧭 This guide will launch publicly on this site soon — and I’m looking for collaborators!

### 📦 STEM Kits for Ethiopia

I’m in the early stages of creating low-cost, high-impact STEM kits to send to schools and students in Ethiopia who lack access to hands-on science materials. These kits will include experiment instructions, basic lab supplies, and QR codes linking to online lessons in Amharic and English.

> ✈️ My goal is to ship the first round of kits by the end of this year.

### 🔭 What’s Next

I believe change is built project by project — with consistency, care, and community. I’m always brainstorming new ways to support young students and expand STEM access.
