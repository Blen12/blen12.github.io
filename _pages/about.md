Hi, I’m Blen, 

I’m a student, mentor, and changemaker who believes in the power of STEM — and more importantly, the power of *access*.  

I immigrated from Ethiopia to Maryland with my mom when I was young. Growing up in a vibrant community of immigrants, I saw firsthand how brilliant, curious, and driven kids can be — even when they don’t have the same resources or opportunities as others.  

That’s why I’ve dedicated myself to bridging the opportunity gap in STEM, especially for immigrants and children of immigrants. I run a mentorship program for younger students, I’m working on a free global STEM resource guide, and I’m building a project to donate STEM kits to underserved communities in Ethiopia.  

This is where I share what I’m building, what I’m learning, and how I hope to make change — one student at a time.
